            However, it is only on the aspect of the state capitalism and market externalities, on the aspect of antitrust, state involvement might not be beneficial. Everyone considers competition as the solution to “corruption, fraud, or other unethical behaviors yield competitive advantages.” (Maurice) The regulators designed antitrust laws to promote the fair competitions among business and protect the consumers, while foreclosing suboptimal competition. Contrarily, excessive competition could “undermine the functions of the antitrust laws” due to states’ poor regulatory controls. (Maurice) However, antitrust officials are overconfident about competitions and don’t believe the negative side of it. The antitrust officers also believe merging and acquisitions as danger area for competition. But merge is good for the companies to some extent. It can “reduce costs”, increase productions for both firms, “improve management”, “reduce tax bill”, etc.  (Keat) Thus, antitrust is not necessarily good for the companies. Officers’ lack of understanding of the market made them biased about the competitions and make inappropriate laws, which will restrict the society and market to grow.

            In addition, competitions may not promote the common good because individual’s and group’s interests diverge when firms lobby, behave unethically, undertake additional risk, or demand a Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) clauses for a relative competitive advantage or for status position. (Maurice) To get competitive advantage, firms compete against each other, other firms follow the example, which made the firm lose its competitive advantage and might even hurt the firm itself. Firms, such as Google and Microsoft, have to lobby for a relative competitive advantage in order to keep up with their competitors and to survive among the businesses, which is a kind of implicit tax and lose of democracy. Firms might behave unethically for a relative competitive advantage. For example, the intermediaries “manipulate information and test results” to get lower price. (Maurice) The companies do not need to do these and can develop better without the antitrust law. Also, increasing competitions among businesses will expand the market and intensify competitions, and the firms would value profits more than quality. Antitrust wants the market to be more competitive, but adding new companies into the market might also be bad for the market and businesses. Thus, state should involve less.
