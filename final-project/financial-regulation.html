            On the aspect of financial regulations, state involvement seems to be helpful for the bureaucrats. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act was a federal law designed to place strict regulations on lenders and banks to protect the consumers and prevent economic recessions. It is a typical monetary policy which is carried out by the Fed through its “control of the quantity of money in the economic system and is directed at attaining certain goals such as economic growth or price stability”. (Keat) However, the effect of the monetary policy (as well as fiscal policy) is not immediate. “There is usually a delay in recognizing that a problem exists … a delay in implementation; a lag for it to work and become effective” (Keat). Thus, in the example of the Dodd-Frank Act, the lawyers made it more complex. They argue that Dodd-Frank still requires “oodles of contestable rules” and “studies on big and small issues” (Too).

            However, these are not what the Dodd-Frank Act needs. The lawyers’ behaviors stifled the innovation, and America's economy suffers. “The lack of clarity which follows from the sheer complexity of the scheme will sometimes provide cover” for the bureaucrats. (Too) Thus, the formulation of laws does not help the economy or the market, but instead help the bureaucrats. It increases the powers of the government and agencies, and the bureaucrats normally serve themselves first, then the interests of the whole economy. With too much state involvement, there is even a problem in little things, such as sacking employees. The banks need to send requests to government agencies in order to avoid violating rules that may or may not exists. Thus, less state involvement is better.
