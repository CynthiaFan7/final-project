      <h2>Market Externalities Aspect</h2>

          <p>From the aspect of the market externalities, some degree of state involvement is needed. A river in Calexico, Southern California “turned into a cesspool, contaminated by the booming human and industrial development on the other side of the border in Mexico.” (Del Real) This river carries pathogens that cause diseases which affect human health, poses a “security issue for border agents” because it is too danger “to go into the water to chase border violators,” and causes serious air pollution, which prevented students from going outside. (Del Real) This is a typical example of cost externalities – “the cases where a producer does not pay all the costs generated by the product” (Keat). The industries did not pay the river or the residence near the river their cost of losing a river and getting diseases, nor did the industry take the responsibilities to clean up the river and return a good environment to the residence.</p>

        <div class='box b'>
          <p>All of these can be solved if the state paid enough attentions, but the bureaucrats did not. The state could involve in and ask the industries to decrease their production, put certain amount of taxation or even create a market for the right to pollute. The state does not need to do much and can ask the industries to trade for the amount of pollutions. “About two dozen stakeholders at the local, state, and federal level have some oversight responsibility for the New River,” but because of the delay of the government, the problem cannot be solved and cause the severe situations. (Del Real) Thus, government should still regulate for a little bit. </p>
