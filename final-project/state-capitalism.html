      <h2>State Capitalism Aspect</h2>
      <section class="grids">
        <div class='box a'>
          <p>From the aspect of the state capitalism, if state involvement is too much, the businessmen might lose their incentive to run the businesses. Guenter Reimann’s “The Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism” indicates that the businessmen are under a severe situation.
          <br><br>
          Firstly, the state has a huge amount of power, but they know nothing but “distributing the wealth”. (Reimann) Government decides the “quantity, quality and price for foreign raw materials”. Thus, there is “no elasticity of price”, which is critical to every business. (Reimann) Without the price elasticity, businesses are forced to sell at a higher price. Then, they are going to be abused, but they cannot argue it is the government decision. This will decrease the businessmen’s incentive to run their business.
          <br><br>
          Secondly, the government only considers about the profits and tax and always increases the taxation. The tax rate is so high that the businessmen never know how much they will actually own after the taxation. The businessmen have no incentive to run business without enough earnings compared to their costs of running the businesses.

          Thirdly, the bureaucracy is in control and the businessmen lost their freedom and rights. The bureaucracy forced these businessmen to cooperate, which prevents the businessmen from economic independence and freedom, and violate their rights. The businesses have to depend on the states. Production becomes a duty, and business cannot be closed without the states’ permission. Then, the businesses might go through a serious deficit or bankrupt. All of these non-sense orders make businessmen only want to hold their jobs. They are afraid of the bureaucratic. They do not want to compete with their competitors nor make profit. Instead, they want to fight against the awful system and fight for their freedom in businesses. This situation is bad for the whole market. Businessmen only run businesses for their remaining properties and rights. This will not generate any more profits for the business and the whole country. Thus, too much state involvement is bad for the markets. </p>

            However, state capitalism is also somewhat good. It leads to the world's most successful big economy, Chinese economy, and lead to the world's most powerful companies, such as the “13 biggest oil firms” and the “world's biggest natural-gas company, Russia's Gazprom.” (Special) State capitalism develops companies “on a much wider scale” and can be a sophisticated tools for citizens’ data collection. (Special) Thus, the state capitalism can be powerful in a bad way (like mentioned in last paragraph) and a good way. But why do these two examples distinct so much? China does not “hand industries to bureaucrats or cronies, it turns them into companies run by professional managers.” (Special) This behavior prevents bureaucracy and can maximally eliminate the compulsions to the businesses. Thus, the Chinese believe their government can provide them better lives with a fair amount of involvement. Thus, with less state involvement, the citizens will trust governments, which is the most important for a country's development. If the citizens believe the system is good and trust their governments will not over control the market, they will allow the government to operate the companies. Thus, from the aspect of the state capitalism, it is better to have little amount of state involvements so that the government earns the trust of the citizens.
